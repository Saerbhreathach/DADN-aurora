		<description>
			<p>Three corpses spasm and twitch, slowly standing back up as the Halfling raises his hand and animates them with dark power so that he might use them as fodder against those enemies that still dare oppose him.</p>
			<p class="indent">An orc grimaces in pain as an arrow grazes its shoulder. A filth covered dwarf gazes with sinister intent at the minor wound and it quickly starts oozing pus, turning green as the orc looks on in panic at the rapidly growing infection.</p>
			<p class="indent">Steping softly out of the shadows, a young elven woman grips the arm of a guard positioned next to the door. With surprising swiftness the limb begins to weaken and with, the flesh rotting as though having spent centuries in the grave. </p>
			<p class="indent">Regardless of the differences in their dark preoccupations, dread necromancers are bound together by the soul-corrupting influence of the evil that rests at the heart of their necromantic power. This dark power can manifest in many dreadful ways, but it eventually turns each and every dread necromancer into an undead abomination.</p>
			<h4>UNSTOPPABLE CORRUPTION</h4>
			<p>Dread necromancers draw their power from a dark taint that lays upon their soul. As they grow in power the taint grows and corrupts their body as well, gradually transforming them into an undead being. There is no abating this process and no going back. Once a dread necromancer is tainted they are forced to find a way to live with the vile power now within their reach.</p>
			<h4>LIVING WITH DEATH</h4>
			<p>Every dread necromancer wields power that is capable of only creating death. For those that embrace it, death becomes their fetish. Their fanatical fascination leads to dark rituals and grim behaviour. Even those that attempt to distance themselves from the true nature of their abilities find that in the end death still follows in their shadow.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A DREAD NECROMANCER</h4>
			<p>When creating a dread necromancer, consider how your character acquired this dark taint. Perhaps your character developed an obsession with death after the passing of a loved one, or from an instance where they died and returned to life. Perhaps your character accidentally stumbled into a long-lost site of unspeakable evil or a dread domain like Ravenloft, escaping only to find they had been tainted by the foul magic that suffuses such places. Maybe your character was born during a time when darkness held sway in the lands, or was used as part of a dark ritual in his or her youth.</p>
			<p class="indent">Have you always been an adventurer as part of the dark path you walk, or was there a time when the forces of good were not hunting you? Perhaps you sought to turn the vile taint you carry against the very villains that helped create you.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a dread necromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a dread necromancer, you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per dread necromancer level</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per dread necromancer level after 1st </li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, shields</li>
				<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons and your choice of any one-handed martial weapon.</li>
				<li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma</li>
				<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Insight, Investigation, Religion, and Survival</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="caption">EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>(a)</i> a shield or <i>(b)</i> any martial weapon </li>
				<li><i>(a)</i> a morningstar or <i>(b)</i> a crossbow </li>
				<li>Padded armor, an explorer's pack, a shovel, and a hooded lantern</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="caption">VARIANTS</h5>
			<p>There are those who eschew the standard path of the Dread Necromancer. Some seek to stave off the dark taint that seeks to overcome them. Those of Elven lineage 
			may be chosen to continue the heritage of their people. Whatever their path, these individuals are no less susceptible to the taint that drives all Dread necromancers,
			and will likewise eventually succumb to their dark fate.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 1st level, the vile stain on your soul begins to warp and foritfy your mortal body. You gain resistance to necrotic damage and add your Constitution modifier to your Armor Class when wearing light armors. Additionally, after you make an attack, cast a spell, or use Charnel Touch, Fell Power, or any of your other class abilities on your turn, you have resistance to damage from opportunity attacks made with non-magical weapons.</p>
			<p class="indent">These changes cause magical healing to affect you differently. When you are the target of magical healing (including potions), you must succeed at a Constitution saving throw at the caster's Spell save DC or only heal half as many hitpoints as the effect would normally heal. Your natural healing is not changed by this ability.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, your touch carries the dark taint of the grave that shrouds your soul. You can touch an adjacent creature as an action, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The target takes 1d8 necrotic damage on a failure, and half damage on a success. When a creature has failed the save against this ability twice, it becomes frightened for one minute. Should it fail the save a third time, it is paralyzed til the end of its next turn on this and every subsequent failed saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">This ability gains greater potency when you reach higher levels: 1d10 necrotic damage at 5th level, 1d12 at 7th, 2d8 at 11th, and 2d10 at 17th level. Additionally, starting at 11th level the target gains one level of exhaustion on a failed save. Levels of exhaustion from this ability do not stack.</p>

			<p>At 5th level, your Fell Power is strong enough that you now use it to censure the living dead. As an action, you release a burst of negative energy that influences all undead within 60 feet of you. Choose a number of undead creatures whose total CR equals your level or lower and select a single-word command that you speak aloud to the targets. This ability works just like the spell <i>command</i>, with the exception that you can only target undead creatures and can affect multiple creatures at one time. And individual undead creature with a CR greater than half your level cannot be affected by this ability. Intelligent undead have advantage on their save.</p>

Mindless undead perceive you as another undead creature and are not hostile towards you unless you or one of your allies attacks.

			<p class="indent">At 17th level, the infusion of dark power throughout your body allows you to capture harmful necrotic energy and use it to recover from wounds.

		<requirements>!ID_INTERNAL_FEATURE_REPLACEMENT_DREAD_NECROMANCER_RITUAL_SACRIFICE</requirements>
		<description>
			<p>Starting at 14th level, you can bolster your terrible power by performing ritualistic sacrifices. Performing a sacrifice requires 2 hours of preparation, 5,000 gold pieces of rare implements and material components, as well as a living victim that must be either incapacitated or restrained for the duration of the ritual. Your victim need not be willing, but should they break free of their bonds or escape you must start the sacrifice performance over from the beginning.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the conclusion of the two-hour long ritual, your sacrificial victim dies and their mortal soul is consumed to fuel your vile power. A creature killed in such a manner cannot be returned to life by anything other than a <i>Wish</i> spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can gain a variety of different boons by performing a living sacrifice. Choose one of the following benefits when you begin preparations for the ceremony. You gain the specified effects the moment your sacrificial victim dies. Each benefit describes how it works and any conditions for obtaining it. You cannot benefit from more than one sacrifice within a period of 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">
			<span class="feature">Bad Weather.</span>The weather within 5 miles of your location turns foul. Dark clouds, driving rains and heavy winds become the prevailing weather, as if you had used the spell <i>Control Weather</i> to change the current conditions. This change takes place immediately and lasts 48 hours.<br />
			<span class="feature">Desecrate Locale.</span>You cast an incredibly powerful version of the spell <i>Hallow</i>. This spell takes effect immediately, affects a radius of 200 feet, and has a duration of three weeks.<br />
			<span class="feature">Devour Memories.</span>All of your victim's memories flood into your mind at once. You can make a Wisdom saving throw equal to 10 + the victim's CR to recall the details of any single memory that you specify at the moment of their death.<br />
			<span class="feature">Fortify Flesh.</span>You are immediately cured of any poisons, diseases, or curses currently afflicting you and your hitpoints are restored to their maximum. Additionally, for the next hour you have resistance to all damage dealt by non-magical weapons.<br />
			<span class="feature">Inspired Spellcasting.</span>You gain the knowledge of how to cast one spell of your choice from the Cleric spell list. The spell's level must not exceed the CR of your sacrificial victim and can be no higher than 7th level. A spell you learn this way can only be cast once and follows all the normal rules for the spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for any spell you gain from this ability and the DC of any spell you cast is equal to 8 + your level + your Charisma modifier.<br />
			<span class="feature">Sow Nightmares.</span>Choose any number of creatures within one mile from your location whose total CR does not exceed the CR of your victim. You must have seen any creature you target within the last 24 hours. You affect each of your selected targets with the <i>Dream</i> spell.<br />
			<span class="feature">Steal Body.</span>Your animus enters the body of your victim, giving you complete control of it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature you sacrificed, though you retain your alignment, and your Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit from your own class features. If the victim had any class levels, you can't use any of their class features. While possessing a body in this manner, you can use your action to return from the host body to your own if it is within 100 feet of you, leaving the victim's body lifeless and unable to be returned to.&#13;
			If the host body dies while you're in it, you must make a Charisma saving throw against DC equal to 8 + your level + your Constitution modifier. On a success, you return to your own body if it is within 100 feet of you, Otherwise, you die. You also die if your own body is destroyed while your animus is not within it.<br />
			<span class="feature">Summon Portent.</span>You ask three questions. You receive answers to each as if you had cast the spell <i>Divination</i>, but you do not suffer an escalating risk of receiving a false answer for each question after the first. Additionally, you cannot wait for the answer to one question before asking the next. All three of your questions must be posed at the same time, immediately following the death of your sacrificial victim. <br />
			<span class="feature">Vile Recovery.</span>You regain one expended use of Fell Power for every 4 CR that your sacrificial victim possessed.<br />

		<description>
			<p>At 20th level, the nefarious power that fills you finally completes your transformation into an undead monstrosity. Your mortal form can no longer contain the twisted and withered thing your soul has become. Ritually extracted from your body, preserved in a specially constructed vessel, the wretched remains of your animus fuels your mortal form and rebuilds it should it ever be destroyed.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">CREATE PHYLACTERY</h5>
			<p>With your soul no longer fit to reside inside your body, you craft a magical artifact that contains it. If this object, also called a phylactery, is intact, your soul 
			will form a new body for your consciousness when you die. It takes 1d6 days for your new body to form and it appears in a space adjacent to your phylactery. If your
			phylactery is ever destroyed, you can spend 48 hours and 10,000 gold pieces to rebuild it. Should you ever perish while your phylactery is broken, your death is permanent
			and cannot be undone by anything short of the intervention of some dark god or unimaginable dread power.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when the phylactery is in your possession you can cast the spell <i>Imprisonment</i> without expending a spell slot or using your Fell
			Power. Any creature imprisoned in this way for a duration of 24 hours dies and their soul is devoured to sustain your body. A creature that dies from this ability can 
			only be raised by a <i>Wish</i> spell. You must complete a long rest before you can cast the spell again.</p>
			<p class="indent">To sustain your undead form, you must use your phylactery to consume a soul once each week. Failing to do so means that you cannot regain hitpoints 
			through any means other than a <i>Wish</i> spell, you cannot use your Fell Power, and your body does not reanimate should you die.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">LICHDOM</h5>
			<p>You gain the Undead type. You no longer need to eat or sleep, though you must still rest for an 8 hour period to gain the benefits of a long rest. You are also immune 
			to disease, poison, and sleep effects. You are vulnerable to radiant damage, but have advantage on saving throws made to resist any effects that specifically target 
			undead creatures. </p>
			<h5 class="caption">HIDDEN SANCTUM</h5>
			<p>To protect your phylactery, you keep it hidden within a secret catacomb or other remote secluded stronghold. If your phylactery has been within the same building for 
			at least 24 hours, your vile presence permeates the location and you gain lair actions as a lich (see the Lich's entry in the Monster Manual for a list of available lair 
			actions.)</p>
			<h5 class="caption">OCCULT SECRETS</h5>
			<p>The process of removing your soul from your body reveals many magical secrets to you. You gain two 7th level spell slots and one each level of 8th and 9th level. 
			Additionally, you learn your choice of three 7th level spells, two 8th level spells, and two 9th level spells selected from the Cleric or Wizard spell list. At least half 
			of the spells you choose must be Necromancy spells. You use your spell slots to cast these spells as a Wizard, and you can use these spell slots to cast your Dark Arcana 
			spells. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells and the DC of any spells you cast with this ability is equal to 8 + your level + your Charisma modifier.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet>
			<description>You construct a phylactery, which, while intact, will reanimate your body in an adjacent space 1d6 days after you die. While you possess your phylactery, you can cast Imprisonment without using a spell slot or your Fell Power. A creature imprisoned for 24 hours dies and feeds your soul. You must feed your phylactery in this way once each week or you cannot regain HP (except a Wish spell), use Fell Power, and you will not reanimate if you die. If your phylactery is destroyed, it costs 10,000gp and 48 hours to rebuild. Until it is rebuilt, you will not reanimate if you die. To protect your phylactery, you hide it in a secret lair. If it remains in this lair for at least 24 hours, you gain lair actions as a lich.&#13;
			You gain two 7th level, one 8th and one 9th level spell slots, and learn three 7th level, two 8th level and twq 9th level spells, at least half of which much be Necromancy spells. You can use these slots to cast your Dark Arcana spells.</description>
